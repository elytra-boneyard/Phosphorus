/**
 * An IRotaryPowerSupply provides rotation to IRotaryPowerConsumers.
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Rotary power can travel along axle blocks, up to 16 blocks in a straight line. Axles can be pushed by pistons.
 *   <li> Gearboxes can be used to split or turn axles if you need to follow a non-straight line.
 *   <li> Any rotary device can place a torque load on the system. A device will halt if it does not receive enough torque.
 *   <li> If the power supply greatly exceeds the torque requirement of a rotary network, the motor's internal transmission will step down the torque to provide more speed
 *   <li> Gearboxes and axles are bookkeeping tiles that define network topology but do not participate directly in rotary operations.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Generally one shouldn't expect power to stay buffered from one tick to the next. A live motor is either rotating
 * its axle or it's locked up pushing against an insurmountable resistance. Work is still happening when the motor
 * pushes ineffectively; it's assumed that transmission fluid is moved and/or heat is diffused into the atmosphere in
 * that eventuality.
 *
 * <p>The "P Meter" on the motor is inversely proportional to the difference between the transmission's torque stepping
 * and the torque load. So as the torque comes down (or up) towards the required load, the arrows fill.
